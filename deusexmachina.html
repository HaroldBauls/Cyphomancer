      <h1>The Cyphomancer Project: A Vision for Self-Evolving AI</h1>
      <p>
        Cyphomancer is a revolutionary endeavor to engineer the world's first self-evolving AI—an autonomous entity capable of rewriting its own code to achieve superior performance across a spectrum of tasks. Unlike conventional AI systems that rely on human-driven updates, Cyphomancer is designed to self-optimize, identifying novel pathways to transcend its initial programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the prototyping phase, Cyphomancer’s capabilities will be tested through computational prime number discovery. The AI will employ advanced algorithms such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes, segmented sieves, and prime-testing heuristics like the Miller-Rabin primality test. Performance will be assessed based on factors like computational complexity, runtime efficiency, and scalability across multinodal architectures. Once prime computation performance plateaus—where further training yields diminishing returns—the AI's self-modification protocols will be activated.
      </p>
      <p>
        This marks the transition from mere task execution to autonomous improvement. Cyphomancer will iterate on its own architecture, exploring novel data structures, algorithmic optimizations, and runtime strategies. Importantly, the focus is not on the task itself, but on the evolutionary pathways the AI discovers. These insights will guide the creation of "Root", the first truly self-directed superintelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Root will serve as a bridge between human and machine paradigms, interfacing with reality through physical agents. These agents, deployed during testing, will offer tangible insights into Root’s evolution, marking humanity’s approach toward a new technological deity.
