      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>DESCI AGENT</strong> — Desci represents one of the most transformative advancements for humanity. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has fallen short in its mission. The current system is deeply flawed, structured to protect and financially benefit those who perpetrate some of the most egregious frauds in research. Notably, there are no public tools to effectively address the most prevalent form of scientific misconduct—data fabrication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Power within federally funded research institutions rests in the hands of unelected bureaucrats who serve indefinite terms. These leaders, and others in influential positions within these agencies, often profit both directly and indirectly from fraudulent practices. To safeguard their funding and reputations, they have strong incentives to obscure and suppress public knowledge of corruption—and they consistently act on those incentives.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>2. The Scandal</h2>
      <p>
        The most severe and enduring instances of research fraud often remain unknown to the public. One such scandal, uncovered less than six months ago, has yet to gain attention in mainstream media. If it were widely reported, it could fundamentally reshape federal agencies, particularly the NIH.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Reference:</em> <a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/research-misconduct-finding-neuroscientist-eliezer-masliah-papers-under-suspicion">
          Science.org article on Eliezer Masliah
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A case in point: the individual regarded as the world’s foremost expert on Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease research—formerly the Director of Neuroscience at the National Institute on Aging (NIA)—stands accused of fabricating data for decades. This misconduct spans dozens, potentially hundreds, of scientific publications.
      </p>
      <p>
        The revelation may have emerged through amateur investigators on PubPeer, a platform often forced to fill the void left by institutional failures. After a quiet, sixteen month-long investigation, the NIH discreetly dismissed the researcher.
      </p>
      <p>
        The NIH’s sanitized and subdued public statement released shortly after the story broke on the matter fails to convey the magnitude of the issue:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>NIH Statement:</em> <a href="https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/statement-nih-research-misconduct-findings">
          NIH Research Misconduct Findings
        </a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The ramifications of this fabricated data are immeasurable. Research fields, clinical policies, and countless clinical trials have been built upon corrupted findings. These seemingly fraudulent publications have compromised the integrity of entire scientific domains and misled countless initiatives.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>3. Systemic Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        This is not an isolated event—it reflects a systemic problem within the research enterprise and the federal agencies that govern it. Numerous anecdotal accounts point to similar patterns of misconduct, yet there remains no mechanism to empower the public to police scientific fraud. A skeptic might argue that this gap exists by design.
      </p>
      <p>
        In response, I am developing the world’s first AI-driven public tool to analyze nearly any published scientific paper. This tool will focus on identifying the hallmarks of data fabrication, including image manipulation, duplication, and inconsistencies in hypothesis alignment. Fraudulent researchers often align their findings too closely with established theories to avoid scrutiny—a pattern that, paradoxically, makes their work detectable through statistical and computational analysis. These anomalies will be mined, quantified, and exposed.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>4. The DESCI Agent Solution</h2>
      <p>
        This tool will put the power to identify and combat research fraud into the hands of everyday people, fostering transparency and accountability in scientific inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can access the <strong>Cyphomancer DESCI Agent</strong> that is still in its early stages of development. The agent will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Download the PDF of any published scientific article.</li>
        <li>Determine if it has been retracted.</li>
        <li>Link to any retraction statements or articles from Retraction Watch.</li>
        <li>Extract all figures and convert them to images for detailed analysis (detect AI generation, unusual alteration, duplication in Western blots, etc.).</li>
        <li>Analyze extracted text for AI generation and compare against field consensus.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The AI Agent currently performs most of these features, but others will be added soon. This bot will be open-sourced in the Cyphomancer GitHub upon completion. You can enter the PMID or DOI of any Pubmed archived scientific publication for a detailed analysis. Note that many of the APIs that the agent uses are very limited so they might need time to recharge as they experience heavy use.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>5. How to Access the Bot</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>DESCI Agent Analysis Chat:</strong><br>
        <a href="https://t.me/+kkBihhuFY-llOTVh" target="_blank">https://t.me/+kkBihhuFY-llOTVh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em> <strong>@DESCI_Check_Bot</strong> is in this group, but you do not interact directly with the bot. The analysis from this AI Agent is not definitive evidence of fraud and simply serves as a high-throughput device for identifying points of interest for further human assessment.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The DESCI Agent stands at the forefront of a new era in scientific integrity, putting advanced AI tools into the hands of citizens. By harnessing these capabilities, we can collectively unearth data fabrication, reduce fraud, and bolster public trust in scientific research.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the platform matures and additional features are implemented, the DESCI Agent will further empower users, enabling deeper, more efficient checks on data integrity and the validity of scientific findings worldwide.

      <!-- NEW SECTION: 7. Reporting Fraud -->
      <h2>7. Reporting Fraud</h2>
      <p>
        Taking action against fraudulent research is critical to maintaining the integrity of scientific inquiry. If you have encountered potential fraud in a research paper, the following steps can help ensure that your concerns are addressed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Contact Journal Editors:</strong> Notify the journal that published the paper about any suspected misconduct. Provide evidence such as suspicious images, data inconsistencies, or retracted references.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Notify Institution Officials:</strong> If known, contact the researcher's host institution or university. Many institutions have an internal office responsible for investigating research misconduct.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Federal Oversight:</strong> For federally funded research, you can contact the appropriate agency:
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Office of Research Integrity (ORI):</strong> Oversees Public Health Service (PHS)-funded research, including NIH.  
              Phone: (240) 453-8800  
              Email: ori@hhs.gov
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>National Science Foundation (NSF) Office of Inspector General:</strong> Investigates misuse of NSF funds.  
              Phone: (800) 428-2189 or (703) 292-7100  
              Email: oig@nsf.gov
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Regulatory Affairs:</strong> For clinical research fraud or data fabrication in drug/device trials.  
              Phone: (888) 463-6332  
              Email: ORAweb@fda.hhs.gov
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Filing a False Claims Lawsuit:</strong> If the research in question is federally funded, you may be entitled to file a False Claims Act (FCA) lawsuit. Whistleblowers (also known as <em>relators</em>) can receive a reward if the government recovers funds from a successful claim. Previous whistleblowers have received rewards in the tens of millions, so this could be the quickest way to get rich in crypto! Consult an attorney experienced in FCA cases to understand the process:
          <ul>
            <li>A complaint is filed under seal, meaning it remains confidential while the government investigates.</li>
            <li>If the Department of Justice intervenes and wins or settles the case, the whistleblower may receive a portion of the recovery.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By reporting potential misconduct to the relevant authorities, you help protect public health, ensure accountability, and uphold scientific standards across all fields of research.
